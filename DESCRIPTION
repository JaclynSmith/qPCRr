Description: This is a package meant to process and graph qPCR data. 
    Our lab generates qPCR data, but there is no streamlined approach to processing it. 
    This package attemps to change that by creating a series of functions to clean and
    process qPCR data, combine multiple experiments together, and graph data. Care was
    taken to allow as much user input as possible.
